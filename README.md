# DensoHireMe.com

This project is my professional React + TypeScript portfolio web application tailored specifically for DENSO hiring managers. It highlights my skills, career history, and provides a downloadable resume to effectively showcase my qualifications for engineering roles at DENSO. The site is developed using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to ensure fast development and seamless deployment.
